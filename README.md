# Hello friends. I use the java backend programming language in this project. 

## -> Why did I create this web service?
## This web service is created so that customers can select and order products. 
## For example: 

There is a customer here who will register and place an order. And there are addresses to which it is connected.
The Product entity has also been created to show the types, prices and quantities of goods in the store.
ProductAll is created where you can see the total number of daily or monthly weekly orders.
Necessary information (about the customer, address to be sent, list of products) is accepted during the product sorting process. Later
The names of the products are checked
As much money as the order is deducted from the customer's account
ProductList is Save and the product is deducted from the quantity


## The technologies I use:
## REST API, Spring Boot,Spring Validation, MySQL, Gradle.
